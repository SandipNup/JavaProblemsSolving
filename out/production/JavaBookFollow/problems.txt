78. Simple var example: Write a program that exemplifies the correct usage of
type inference (var) with respect to the code's readability.
79. Using var with primitive types: Write a program that exemplifies the
usage of var with Java primitive types (int, long, float, and double).
80. Using var and implicit type casting to sustain the code's maintainability:
Write a program that exemplifies how var and implicit type casting can
sustain the code's maintainability.
81. Explicit downcast or better avoid var: Write a program that exemplifies
the combination of var and explicit downcast and explain why var should
be avoided.
82. Avoid using var if the called names don't contain enough type
information for humans: Provide examples where var should be avoided
because its combination with called names causes loss of information for
humans.
83. Combining LVTI and programming to the interface technique: Write a
program that exemplifies the usage of var via the programming to the
interface technique.
